## Motivation

I read the New York Times online constantly, it serves worldclass journalism and excellent short-form writing all day long. They also have a generous team of developers who maintain a public and data-rich API.

Looking for a way to sharpen my React knowledge while maintaining a daily dose of NYT articles, I decided to create a stripped down news site sourcing all content from the NYT API.

* [NYT Developer APIs](https://developer.nytimes.com/) (Most Popular API, Top Stories API, Books API, Movies API)
